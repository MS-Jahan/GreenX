# GreenX
GreenX is a prototype App and Robot which was presented on Nasa Space Apps Challenge 2020 from the team OrionVI. Our challenge was to introduce a new way to communicate the importance of environmental responsibility to people of all ages. Our app will work for spreading a silent tendency of planting tress. 

In this application a beginner has to plant a tree and upload the picture of it into the app “UPLOAD IMAGE” section. This act has to continue till the end of the game, in the whole game life a user has to plant 3 trees in 1.5 month. Again, the users will be nominated as the “Best Award Holder” for highest position in the world leaderboard. Following this we also developed a robot that is specialized for gardening,farming and for GreenHouse also. This robot will allow us to do direct interaction with the environment by analysis user current data. Like our climate is changing so fast that’s why biodiversity is also happening. Our robot will help the user to understand the environment statement and also advise them about harvesting plants in their garden or farms. Thus our project will help to develop a practice of planting trees and create social awareness in the world. 

Again, it was just a prototype. Both the app and robot was incomplete and as we couldn't compete in global round. the project remained __incomplete__.

The code of app was fully written by [me](github.com/ms-Jahan) and the code of robot was from [Abrar Shahid](https://github.com/abrarshahid).
